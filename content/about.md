## About Oysterdale Records

Founded in 2025, Oysterdale Records is a label built on groove, soul, and a deep love for dance music. From dusty basements to rooftop sessions, we champion the sound of tomorrow rooted in the essence of disco, house, funk, and beyond.

With each release, we open a new shell â€” revealing a carefully crafted pearl.

Our artists are producers, DJs, instrumentalists and storytellers. And our mission is simple: to create dance music that lasts.
